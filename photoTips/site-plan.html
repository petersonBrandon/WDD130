        Welcome to Brandon’s Photography Tips!
        <br>I have been a hobby photographer for about 10 years now and want to share what I have learned with anyone and everyone that wants to learn to take some wonderful photos! So I have created this website! First, a little about me. I started photography when I was about 12/13 when my mom gave me one of her old cameras. I loved figuring out how it worked and seeing what I could do to take really pretty pictures. I would get done with school and homework and just go outside to take pictures of whatever I felt like. I personally really enjoy macro photography, taking pictures of really small things. However, over the years I have grow to really like landscape and portrait photography as well. I have had opportunities to photograph some beautiful places. From the jungles of Honduras to the deserts of Arizona, I have been to quite a few places and had the opportunity to photograph in many different conditions. All of the pictures on this site, except the ones found on the gear page, are pictures that I personally have taken.
        <br>I have some general tips that have helped me over the years along with a list of gear that I have found very useful.

      <h3>Tips</h3>
      <p>
        Photography while complex can be wrapped into three key items. Framing, Lighting, and Focus. While it is impossible to explain everything there is to know about photography, and not to mention that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, below are some explanations of each of these elements.
        <br>Framing:
        <br>Ever seen a photo where a person or animal is square in the middle of the picture and it seems off? Or ever see a photo where a person is cut off on the side of the photo? These are examples of poor framing. Framing is one of the most important things within a photo. Keeping a subject in frame and within what is called the “Rule of Thirds” will really help to increase the quality of your photos. 
        <br>Now you might ask, what is the “Rule of Thirds?” That is an excellent question. The “Rule of Thirds” is where you divide the photo into a 3x3 grid (Most digital cameras and phones have the option to show this grid over the screen). Keeping the subject of your photo on one to two of the four crosshairs of the grid is how one keeps the rule of thirds. 
        <br>So the best way to make sure you have good framing is to position your subject in one to two of the crosshairs show in the rule of thirds grid.
        <br>Lighting:
        <br>Lighting is also extremely important. Luckily most modern cameras have an auto feature that adjusts all of the camera settings according to the light in order to get the best photo it can. However, that does not change the fact that making sure you’re lighting is the best that it can be to achieve the best results.
        <br>Things to look out for with lighting:
        <br>·	Backlight
        <br>·	Extreme brightness
        <br>·	Extreme darkness
        <br>·	Natural lighting
        <br>Backlighting is when a subject has a bright light shining behind them. This will cause the subject to become more of a silhouette and will wash out a lot of their details along with the details of the background. Avoid bright light directly behind the subject you are photographing, unless there is a specific affect you are going for within the picture.
        <br>Lastly, use natural lighting to your advantage. Personally I try to avoid using lamps, flashlights, etc. when taking photos unless it is at night. Natural light is just that, natural. It is what we see day to day and are eyes are accustomed to. For example, using light casting through a window, can be extremely useful when taking indoor photographs. Or using some light rays bursting through the clouds can look amazing!
        <br>Focus:
        <br>The focus is the last item to discuss about taking pictures. Focus is very important to draw attention to what you want to have attention. If you are taking a picture of a grand valley or mountain range, you will want to have as much in focus as possible so that anyone that sees the photo can almost feel the scale of the valley or mountains and it will almost feel like they are there. If you are taking a picture of a small flower, you’ll probably want to have the flower in focus with the rest out of focus to draw attention to the flower. Luckily most camera’s and phones are pretty adept at pulling focus to what you are taking a photo of. It is simply something to be mindful of when you are snapping your shots.

      <h3>Gear</h3>
      <p>
        <br>While only a camera is really all that one needs to get started taking amazing photos, there are some tools that I have found to be very useful. 
        <br>Case:
        <br>Most camera’s come with a case; however, investing in a good, quality case can really make a difference. It can allow room for expansion if you get more batteries, lenses, etc. It will keep your camera safe when traveling from location to location. No quality does not necessarily mean expensive. There are plenty of quality cases that are available at affordable prices. Doing a little bit of research will help to find the case that is right for you.
        <br>Tripod:
        <br>Having a solid tripod is something that I have used in almost every photo shoot that I do. Having that steady surface to put the camera so there is no shake (especially when taking photos in low light) really helps. Even when I am hiking quite a bit, I tend to want to bring at least a small portable tripod that I can set up on a rock or the dirt so I can get the pictures I want. There are many different brands to choose from when buying tripods. I personally like Manfroto as they are very robust and last a long time, but they can be on the more expensive side. There are plenty of good quality tripods to be found at cheaper prices. One just might have to research a bit before picking one.
        <br>Polarizing lens:
        <br>A polarizing lens is a very simple little filter that sits over the end of your lens. While it is small and usually pretty inexpensive, it helps to create some beautiful pictures by color correcting some of the light that the camera sees. Normally the blue sky is a little difficult for the camera to see and so it will look more washed out in pictures. Putting a polarizing lens on helps to keep the sky nice and blue as well as keep other colors that might normally get lost. All of my lenses have one of these on them.
        <br>Different lenses:
        <br>This is probably the most expensive out of all the gear you can get. Lenses are extremely useful and diverse but can cost a pretty penny. Depending on the photos you want to take there are so many lenses to choose from. Telephoto lenses help to zoom in to things really far away. Macro lenses help focus on very small things. Variable zoom lenses help to change to range of your focus. The list goes on. While one can get away with one maybe two lenses it definitely is helpful to have some specialty lenses for different occasions.
