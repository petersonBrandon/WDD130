            While only a camera is really all that one needs to get started
            taking amazing photos, there are some tools that I have found to be
            very useful.

            <h1>Case:</h1>

              </div>
              <p>
                Most camera's come with a case; however, investing in a good,
                quality case can really make a difference. It can allow room for
                expansion if you get more batteries, lenses, etc. It will keep
                your camera safe when traveling from location to location. No
                quality does not necessarily mean expensive. There are plenty of
                quality cases that are available at affordable prices. Doing a
                little bit of research will help to find the case that is right
                for you.

              </div>
              <p>
                Having a solid tripod is something that I have used in almost
                every photo shoot that I do. Having that steady surface to put
                the camera so there is no shake (especially when taking photos
                in low light) really helps. Even when I am hiking quite a bit, I
                tend to want to bring at least a small portable tripod that I
                can set up on a rock or the dirt so I can get the pictures I
                want.

              There are many different brands to choose from when buying
              tripods. I personally like Manfroto as they are very robust and
              last a long time, but they can be on the more expensive side.
              There are plenty of good quality tripods to be found at cheaper
              prices. One just might have to research a bit before picking one.

                A polarizing lens is a very simple little filter that sits over
                the end of your lens. While it is small and usually pretty
                inexpensive, it helps to create some beautiful pictures by color
                correcting some of the light that the camera sees.
              </p>

              Normally the blue sky is a little difficult for the camera to see
              and so it will look more washed out in pictures. Putting a
              polarizing lens on helps to keep the sky nice and blue as well as
              keep other colors that might normally get lost. All of my lenses
              have one of these on them.

              This is probably the most expensive out of all the gear you can
              get. Lenses are extremely useful and diverse but can cost a pretty
              penny.
            </p>
            <div id="lenses_image_section">
              <div id="lenses_image_wrapper">
                <img src="./images/Optimized/Lenses.jpg" alt="Lenses" />
              </div>
              <p>
                Telephoto lenses help to zoom in to things really far away.
                Macro lenses help focus on very small things. Variable zoom
                lenses help to change to range of your focus.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              The list goes on. While one can get away with one maybe two lenses
              it definitely is helpful to have some specialty lenses for
              different occasions.
