          I have been a hobby photographer for about 10 years now and want to
          share what I have learned with anyone and everyone that wants to learn
          to take some wonderful photos! So I have created this website! First,
          a little about me. I started photography when I was about 12/13 when
          my mom gave me one of her old cameras. I loved figuring out how it
          worked and seeing what I could do to take really pretty pictures. I
          would get done with school and homework and just go outside to take
          pictures of whatever I felt like. I personally really enjoy macro
          photography, taking pictures of really small things. However, over the
          years I have grow to really like landscape and portrait photography as
          well. I have had opportunities to photograph some beautiful places.
          From the jungles of Honduras to the deserts of Arizona, I have been to
          quite a few places and had the opportunity to photograph in many
          different conditions.

          <p>
            All of the pictures on this site, except the ones found on the gear
            page, are pictures that I personally have taken.
