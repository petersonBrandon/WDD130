            I have been a hobby photographer for about 10 years now and want to
            share what I have learned with anyone and everyone that wants to
            learn to take some wonderful photos! So I have created this website!
          </p>
          <p>
            First, a little about me. I started photography when I was about
            12/13 when my mom gave me one of her old cameras. I loved figuring
            out how it worked and seeing what I could do to take really pretty
            pictures. I would get done with school and homework and just go
            outside to take pictures of whatever I felt like. I personally
            really enjoy macro photography, taking pictures of really small
            things. However, over the years I have grow to really like landscape
            and portrait photography as well. I have had opportunities to
            photograph some beautiful places. From the jungles of Honduras to
            the deserts of Arizona, I have been to quite a few places and had
            the opportunity to photograph in many different conditions.

            All of the pictures on this site, except the ones found on the gear
            page, are pictures that I personally have taken.
