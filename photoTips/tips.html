            Photography while complex can be wrapped into three key items.
            Framing, Lighting, and Focus. While it is impossible to explain
            everything there is to know about photography, and not to mention
            that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, below are some
            explanations of each of these elements.
          </p>
          <section id="framing_section">
            <h1>Framing:</h1>
            <div id="framing_grid_section">
              <p class="framing_section_text grid_row_1">
                Ever seen a photo where a person or animal is square in the
                middle of the picture and it seems off? Or ever see a photo
                where a person is cut off on the side of the photo? These are
                examples of poor framing. Framing is one of the most important
                things within a photo. Keeping a subject in frame and within
                what is called the “Rule of Thirds” will really help to increase
                the quality of your photos.
              </p>
              <div id="framing_image_wrapper">
                <img src="./images/Optimized/Framing.jpg" alt="Framing" />
              </div>
              <p class="framing_section_text grid_row_2">
                Now you might ask, what is the “Rule of Thirds?” That is an
                excellent question. The “Rule of Thirds” is where you divide the
                photo into a 3x3 grid (Most digital cameras and phones have the
                option to show this grid over the screen). Keeping the subject
                of your photo on one to two of the four crosshairs of the grid
                is how one keeps the rule of thirds.
              </p>
              <p class="framing_section_text grid_row_3">
                So the best way to make sure you have good framing is to
                position your subject in one to two of the crosshairs show in
                the rule of thirds grid.

            </div>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h1>Lighting:</h1>
            <p>
              Lighting is also extremely important. Luckily most modern cameras
              have an auto feature that adjusts all of the camera settings
              according to the light in order to get the best photo it can.
              However, that does not change the fact that making sure you’re
              lighting is the best that it can be to achieve the best results.
            </p>
            <div id="lighting_list">
              <h2>Things to look out for with lighting:</h2>
              <ul>
                <li>Backlight</li>
                <li>Extreme Darkness</li>
                <li>Extreme Brightness</li>
                <li>Natural Lighting</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div id="lighting_right_overlap">
              <div class="lighting_image_wrapper" id="lighting_right_image">
                <img src="./images/Optimized/Lighting.jpg" alt="Lighting 1" />
              </div>
              <p>
                Backlighting is when a subject has a bright light shining behind
                them. This will cause the subject to become more of a silhouette
                and will wash out a lot of their details along with the details
                of the background. Avoid bright light directly behind the
                subject you are photographing, unless there is a specific affect
                you are going for within the picture.
              </p>
            </div>
            <p>
              Having too much light or too little light is also not good. While
              technological advancements can allow to shoot in very bright and
              very dark environments, not all cameras are equipped to do so.
              Knowing the limits of your camera is key. Too bright and the
              subject gets washed out and details are lost. Too dark and details
              are lost as well. Cloudy days are really great because it blocks
              the harshness of the sun’s light and creates a more soft light.
              Really sunny days work too, just be sure your subject is not
              backlit as explained in the previous paragraph.
            </p>
            <div id="lighting_left_overlap">
              <div class="lighting_image_wrapper" id="lighting_left_image">
                <img src="./images/Optimized/Lighting_2.jpg" alt="Lighting 2" />
              </div>
              <p>
                Lastly, use natural lighting to your advantage. Personally I try
                to avoid using lamps, flashlights, etc. when taking photos
                unless it is at night. Natural light is just that, natural. It
                is what we see day to day and are eyes are accustomed to. For
                example, using light casting through a window, can be extremely
                useful when taking indoor photographs. Or using some light rays
                bursting through the clouds can look amazing!

          </section>
          <section id="focus_section">
            <h1>Focus:</h1>
            <p>
              The focus is the last item to discuss about taking pictures. Focus
              is very important to draw attention to what you want to have
              attention.
            </p>
            <div class="focus_flex">
              <img src="./images/Optimized/Focus_2.jpg" alt="Focus 1" />
              <p>
                If you are taking a picture of a grand valley or mountain range,
                you will want to have as much in focus as possible so that
                anyone that sees the photo can almost feel the scale of the
                valley or mountains and it will almost feel like they are there.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class="focus_flex">
              <p>
                If you are taking a picture of a small flower, you’ll probably
                want to have the flower in focus with the rest out of focus to
                draw attention to the flower.
              </p>
              <img src="./images/Optimized/Focus.jpg" alt="Focus 2" />
            </div>
            <p>
              Luckily most camera’s and phones are pretty adept at pulling focus
              to what you are taking a photo of. It is simply something to be
              mindful of when you are snapping your shots.
